# Invariants in C++

**To generate the latest version of the paper, first install the `mpark/wg21` dependencies, specified [here](https://github.com/mpark/wg21#requirements).**

```bash
make paper.pdf
```

It will appear in the `generated/` directory (which is gitignored).

# Notes

Keep in mind that generating the paper will fail if there are no references in the paper. See [this open issue](https://github.com/mpark/wg21/issues/90)
